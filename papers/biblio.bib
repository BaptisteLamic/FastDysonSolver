	abstract = {We propose a method to improve the computational and memory efficiency of numerical solvers for the nonequilibrium Dyson equation in the Keldysh formalism. It is based on the empirical observation that the nonequilibrium Green's functions and self energies arising in many problems of physical interest, discretized as matrices, have low rank off-diagonal blocks, and can therefore be compressed using a hierarchical low rank data structure. We describe an efficient algorithm to build this compressed representation on the fly during the course of time stepping, and use the representation to reduce the cost of computing history integrals, which is the main computational bottleneck. For systems with the hierarchical low rank property, our method reduces the computational complexity of solving the nonequilibrium Dyson equation from cubic to near quadratic, and the memory complexity from quadratic to near linear. We demonstrate the full solver for the Falicov-Kimball model exposed to a rapid ramp and Floquet driving of system parameters, and are able to increase feasible propagation times substantially. We present examples with 262 144 time steps, which would require approximately five months of computing time and 2.2 TB of memory using the direct time stepping method, but can be completed in just over a day on a laptop with less than 4 GB of memory using our method. We also confirm the hierarchical low rank property for the driven Hubbard model in the weak coupling regime within the GW approximation, and in the strong coupling regime within dynamical mean-field theory.},

@article{Jacquet2020,
	abstract = {We consider the out-of-equilibrium behavior of a general class of mesoscopic devices composed of several superconducting or/and normal metal leads separated by quantum dots. Starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian description, we provide a nonperturbative approach to quantum electronic transport in the tunneling amplitudes between dots and leads: using the equivalent of a path integral formulation, the lead degrees of freedom are integrated out in order to compute both the current and the current correlations (noise) in this class of systems, in terms of the dressed Green's function matrix of the quantum dots. In order to illustrate the efficiency of this formalism, we apply our results to the "all superconducting Cooper pair beam splitter,"a device composed of three superconducting leads connected via two quantum dots, where crossed Andreev reflection operates Cooper pair splitting. Commensurate voltage differences between the three leads allow us to obtain expressions for the current and noise as a function of the Keldysh Nambu Floquet dressed Green's function of the dot system. This voltage configuration allows the occurrence of nonlocal processes involving multiple Cooper pairs which ultimately lead to the presence of nonzero DC currents in an out-of-equilibrium situation. We investigate in detail the results for the noise obtained numerically in the specific case of opposite voltages, where the transport properties are dominated by the so called "quartet processes,"involving the coherent exchange of two Cooper pairs among all three superconducting terminals. We show that these processes are noiseless in the nonresonant case, and that this property is also observed for other voltage configurations. When the dots are in a resonant regime, the noise characteristics change qualitatively, with the appearance of giant Fano factors.},

@article{NESSI,
	abstract = {The nonequilibrium dynamics of correlated many-particle systems is of interest in connection with pump–probe experiments on molecular systems and solids, as well as theoretical investigations of transport properties and relaxation processes. Nonequilibrium Green's functions are a powerful tool to study interaction effects in quantum many-particle systems out of equilibrium, and to extract physically relevant information for the interpretation of experiments. We present the open-source software package NESSi (The Non-Equilibrium Systems Simulation package) which allows to perform many-body dynamics simulations based on Green's functions on the L-shaped Kadanoff–Baym contour. NESSi contains the library libcntr which implements tools for basic operations on these nonequilibrium Green's functions, for constructing Feynman diagrams, and for the solution of integral and integro-differential equations involving contour Green's functions. The library employs a discretization of the Kadanoff–Baym contour into time N points and a high-order implementation of integration routines. The total integrated error scales up to O(N−7), which is important since the numerical effort increases at least cubically with the simulation time. A distributed-memory parallelization over reciprocal space allows large-scale simulations of lattice systems. We provide a collection of example programs ranging from dynamics in simple two-level systems to problems relevant in contemporary condensed matter physics, including Hubbard clusters and Hubbard or Holstein lattice models. The libcntr library is the basis of a follow-up software package for nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory calculations based on strong-coupling perturbative impurity solvers.

Fast HSS algorithms including new HSS structure generation and HSS form Cholesky factorization are developed. Moreover, we provide a new linear complexity explicit ULV factorization algorithm for symmetric positive definite HSS matrices with a low-rank property. The corresponding factors can be used to solve the HSS systems also in linear complexity. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithms.

	abstract = {Randomized sampling has recently been pro ven a highly efficient technique for computing approximate factorizations of matrices that have low numerical rank. This paper describes an extension of such techniques to a wider class of matrices that are not themselves rank-deficient but have off-diagonal blocks that are; specifically, the class of so-called hierarchically semiseparable (HSS) matrices. HSS matrices arise frequently in numerical analysis and signal processing, particularly in the construction of fast methods for solving differential and integral equations numerically. The HSS structure admits algebraic operations (matrix-vector multiplications, matrix factorizations, matrix inversion, etc.) to be performed very rapidly, but only once the HSS representation of the matrix has been constructed. How to rapidly compute this representation in the first place is much less well understood. The present paper demonstrates that if an N × N matrix can be applied to a vector in O(N) time, and if individual entries of the matrix can be computed rapidly, then provided that an HSS representation of the matrix exists, it can be constructed in O(N k 2) operations, where k is an upper bound for the numerical rank of the off-diagonal blocks. The point is that when legacy codes (based on, e.g., the fast multipole method) can be used for the fast matrix-vector multiply, the proposed algorithm can be used to obtain the HSS representation of the matrix, and then well-established techniques for HSS matrices can be used to invert or factor the matrix. {\textcopyright} 2011 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

Also notable is the fact that leading statisticians at that time used semiseparable matrices without knowing their inverses to be tridiagonal. During this historical evolution the definition of semiseparable matrices has always been a difficult point leading to misunderstandings; sometimes they were defined as the inverses of irreducible tridiagonal matrices leading to generator representable matrices, while in other cases they were defined as matrices having low rank blocks below the diagonal.},

@article{Talarico2019,
	abstract = {A numerical method to solve the set of Dyson-like equations in the framework of non-equilibrium Green's functions is presented. The technique is based on the self-consistent solution of the Dyson equations for the interacting single-particle Green's function once a choice for the self-energy, functional of the single-particle Green's function itself, is made. The authors briefly review the theory of the non-equilibrium Green's functions in order to highlight the main point useful in discussing the proposed technique. Then, the numerical implementationis presented and discussed, which is based on the distribution of the Keldysh components of the Green's function and the self-energy on a grid of processes. It is discussed how the structure of the considered self-energy approximations influences the distribution of the matrices in order to minimize the communication time among processes and which should be considered in the case of other approximations. The authors give an example of the application of this technique to the case of quenches in ultracold gases and to the single impurity Anderson model, also discussing the convergence and the stability features of the approach.},

@article{KayeEquilibrium,
	abstract = {We consider the numerical solution of the real time equilibrium Dyson equation, which is used in calculations of the dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems. We show that this equation can be written as a system of coupled, nonlinear, convolutional Volterra integro-differential equations, for which the kernel depends self-consistently on the solution. As is typical in the numerical solution of Volterra-type equations, the computational bottleneck is the quadratic-scaling cost of history integration. However, the structure of the nonlinear Volterra integral operator precludes the use of standard fast algorithms. We propose a quasilinear-scaling FFT-based algorithm which respects the structure of the nonlinear integral operator. The resulting method can reach large propagation times, and is thus well-suited to explore quantum many-body phenomena at low energy scales. We demonstrate the solver with two standard model systems: the Bethe graph, and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.},

@article{Fornberg2019,
	abstract = {The quadrature formulas described by James Gregory (1638–1675) improve the accuracy of the trapezoidal rule by adjusting the weights near the ends of the integration interval. In contrast to the Newton–Cotes formulas, their weights are constant across the main part of the interval. However, for both of these approaches, the polynomial Runge phenomenon limits the orders of accuracy that are practical. For the algorithm presented here, this limitation is greatly reduced. In particular, quadrature formulas on equispaced 1-D node sets can be of high order (tested here up through order 20) without featuring any negative weights.},
